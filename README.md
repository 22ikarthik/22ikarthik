👋 Hi, I’m Ishwar Karthik (he/him). I'm a rising senior (high school), enrolled in the IB Diploma Programme at the American School of Doha. I'm Indian (born in Chennai),
but have lived in Doha, Qatar for nearly my entire life. I was born on 23 November 2003, so right now I'm 17.
- 👀 I’m interested in math, computer science, and physics at the moment. All of these interest me, and so at the moment I'm trying to learn as much of these 3 as possible
to better enable me to decide on a college major.
- 🌱 I’ve taken Discrete Math and Intro to AI with Python at Harvard Summer School.
- For my IB Diploma, I'm doing my EE on quaternionic analysis, which has been fascinating.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on programs with scientific and mathematical significance.
- 📫 How to reach me - Email at 22ikarthik@asd.edu.qa is best right now, but ishwarkarthik@gmail.com will last until after I graduate high school, so that's the most future-proof.
For now, the former will result in quicker responses, but the latter is probably best if you want to send to the same email address for multiple years.
